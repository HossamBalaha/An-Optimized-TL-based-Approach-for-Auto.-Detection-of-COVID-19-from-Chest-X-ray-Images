## (2) Abstract:
Accurate and fast detection of COVID-19 patients is crucial to control this pandemic. Due to the scarcity of COVID-19 testing kits, especially in developing countries, there is a crucial need to rely on alternative diagnosis methods. Deep learning architectures built on image modalities can speed up the COVID-19 pneumonia classification from other types of pneumonia. The transfer learning approach is better suited to automatically detect COVID-19 cases due to the limited availability of medical images. This paper introduces an Optimized Transfer Learning-based Approach for Automatic Detection of COVID-19 (OTLD-COVID-19) that applies an optimization algorithm to twelve CNN architectures to diagnose COVID-19 cases using chest x-ray images. The OTLD-COVID-19 approach adapts Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm to optimize the network hyperparametersâ€™ values of the CNN architectures to improve their classification performance. The proposed dataset is collected from eight different public datasets to classify 4-class cases (COVID-19, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia viral, and normal). The experimental result showed that DenseNet121 optimized architecture achieves the best performance. The evaluation results based on Loss, Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, Specificity, AUC, Sensitivity, IoU, and Dice values reached 0.0523, 98.47%, 0.9849, 98.50%, 98.47%, 99.50%, 0.9983, 0.9847, 0.9860, and 0.9879 respectively.
